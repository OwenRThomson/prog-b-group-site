    Computer Science is instrumental in the modern global logistics network.
</p>
<p>
    From businesses to personal transport, without CS, nothing would be possible in our
    interconnected world.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Some applications of CS in our modern world which you may or may not be aware of:

<h3>Traffic Management:</h3>
<p>
    Increasingly global cities rely on massive networks pulling from hundreds of sensors across the
    city
    to automatically manage their traffic flow and adjust to live conditions.
</p>
<p>
    This is an <a
        href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/traffic-management-system">active
    area of research</a>
    with constant development and innovation; especially as optimising our city's traffic flows,
    integrating self-driving vehicles and minimising congestion becomes integral to meeting climate
    targets.
</p>

<h3>Weather Forecasting:</h3>
<p>
    Weather forecasting plays a critical part in enabling things like global aviation and shipping
    to run safely and efficiently.
    Organisations will often have their own entire divisions dedicated to meteorological
    predictions.

<h3>Self Driving:</h3>

                Self driving cars are slowly growing in popularity as they become more accessible
                and affordable.
                While the technology's roll-out is currently fraught with issues, many hope that
                continuing advances in computer vision and AI
                will mean we eventually reach a point where we can safely have fully autonomous
                vehicles on our roads.
