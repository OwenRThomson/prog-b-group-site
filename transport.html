  <p>
    Computer Science is instrumental in the modern global logistics network.
  </p>
  <p>
    From businesses to personal transport, without CS, nothing would be possible in our interconnected world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some applications of CS in our modern world which you may or may not be aware of:

        <h3>Traffic Management:</h3>
        <p>
          Increasingly global cities rely on massive networks pulling from hundreds of sensors across the city
          to automatically manage their traffic flow and adjust to live conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/traffic-management-system">active area of research</a>
          with constant development and innovation; especially as optimising our city's traffic flows,
          integrating self-driving vehicles and minimising congestion becomes integral to meeting climate targets.
