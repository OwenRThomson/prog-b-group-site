    Computer Science is instrumental in the modern global logistics network.
  </p>
  <p>
    From businesses to personal transport, without CS, nothing would be possible in our interconnected world.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Some applications of CS in our modern world which you may or may not be aware of:
  </p>

  <h3>Traffic Management:</h3>
  <p>
    Increasingly global cities rely on massive networks pulling from hundreds of sensors across the city
    to automatically manage their traffic flow and adjust to live conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/traffic-management-system">active area of research</a>
    with constant development and innovation; especially as optimising our city's traffic flows,
    integrating self-driving vehicles and minimising congestion becomes integral to meeting climate targets.
  </p>

  <h3>Weather Forecasting:</h3>
  <p>
    Weather forecasting plays a critical part in enabling things like global aviation and shipping to run safely and efficiently.
    Organisations will often have their own entire divisions dedicated to meteorological predictions.
  </p>

  <h3>Self Driving:</h3>
